The actual outputs of the clustering, though just csvs, are too large for Github due to the sheer number of entries. For reference, I include a screenshot of the type of output from the Wildlife Acoustics software.

The meaningful items in this folder are:
1) the EDA_clusters file, which summarizes the results.
2) the python file used to generate the clusters
